ATN Project 1

Simulated a network with number of nodes = N, the traffc demand values (bij) between pairs of nodes, and the unit cost values for the potential links (aij).

The program designs a network with given capacity, so that the given demand can be satisfied and the overall cost is minimum.

The program also computes the total cost of the designed network and density.
